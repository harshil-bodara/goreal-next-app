Steve Anderson, who was the founder of Baseline Ventures, invested $250,000 in Systrom’s idea for an app called Burbn that allowed users to share their location with friends, but he requested that Systrom find a partner to work with in developing the app. Systrom found Krieger, and between the two of them they simplified the original idea, making it a simple photo-sharing app. Unlike most apps and businesses which are built from the ground up, Instagram is unique in that it was actually built from a pre-existing app taken down to its most basic components.It was introduced to Apple in 2010, and before the app would even be introduced to Android in 2012, it already had more than thirty million users.

This was just an indicator of the enormous success that Instagram would see throughout the next few years. This is probably why Facebook made the wise decision to purchase Facebook for $1 billion in cash and stocks. The purchase of Instagram by Facebook was actually quite astonishing, considering the fact that Instagram was not generating any revenue at all at the time.<br /><br /></p>

In 2013, Instagram introduced direct messaging to the platform, which gave users more direct contact with one another. In 2015, advertising was added to the platform, which is how they began to generate some serious revenue. They also introduced live streaming, which again increased the direct contact between users. One of the most recent updates to the platform was the change that made likes hidden from users. The idea behind this was to place less focus on the likes, and more on engagement between users. This change has not been around long enough to really know the impact yet, but the response seems to be fairly positive for the time being. Even though likes are now hidden from other users, they are still just as valuable to anyone attempting a promotional campaign for a business or organization, </span><em>because likes are still the best way to measure your reach on Instagram.</em></p>

A like is what the viewer does to indicate to you that they have viewed something that you posted, and that they enjoyed it or agreed with it. By double-tapping the video or picture, the viewer “likes” it, and each like is added to a tally that is visible only to the person or organization that posted it. Likes are not meant to share the picture or video with other viewers, and they do not indicate that the person intends to do any business with your company. Likes are nothing more than an acknowledgement that your post was viewed and appreciated. That being said, likes are vitally important, but not as easy to come by as you might think. In this article, we will continue to explore the surprisingly complex system of gaining likes on Instagram. </span></p>

The new algorithm was introduced to replace the old chronological order because Instagram was becoming so popular, with over 400 million users at the time, that showing the posts chronologically was no longer a sensible way for the platform to operate. Another reason for the change was the introduction of advertisements, which would be fitted into the new algorithm. </span></p>

The new algorithm would upend the whole marketing operation on Instagram, because now technology would decide who wees what based on the users own follows, and who they actually engage with. This was great for the individual user, but proved to be a difficult change for social media marketers. The marketers adapted to the new system, of course, but the algorithm is fairly organic and changes regularly, so marketers are forced to stay on their toes and adapt to regular changes. Overall the new algorithm seems to have had a positive impact on the platform, and the response from users seems fairly receptive. </span></p>

Instagram uses Facebook Business to operate its advertising, and Facebook has access to more information about individuals than perhaps any other platform in the world. This means that every advertiser can find out if you are interested in sports cars, classical music, weight loss, chocolate, family photography, or all of the above. If you have ever expressed an interest in anything that can be sold, Facebook Business knows about it, and they can use that information to target very specific demographics. This caused a great deal of controversy during the 2016 presidential elections. While the concern about this is quite understandable, at the end </span>of the day it hardly matters as far as advertising is concerned, because advertising is not just about informing one specific base demographic, it is also about expanding the base. Advertising will always be focused on converting those that were not previously interested, which means the primary goal of all advertisement is to reach as many people as possible. Yes, they can and do use user’s information to target specific groups, but chances are most of those users would see those advertisements anyway.</p>

Keep in mind that more money does not automatically equal a more impactful campaign. If you are looking to sell an app that connects members of one specific neighborhood in one specific city, you don’t really need a budget big enough for a nationwide campaign. In fact, you might even be able to get away with something like an influencer putting the word out, in which case you may not even need an advertising campaign. </span></p>

Earlier we said that the main goal of advertising is to reach as many people as possible, including those that are not already in your base, but that does not mean it isn’t essential that you know who your base is. For instance, if you were writing a young adult fantasy novel about a group of female heroes fighting against a tyrannical male, your first instinct might be to think that your core demographic is young females between the ages of 14-21. While that is probably true, there would also be some room for young males in college, feminist activist groups, and just fantasy-genre lovers in general. You can test different core groups in order to find the most profitable demographic. The key here is for you to focus on your demographic when creating and advertising so that you can keep your base, while also attempting to expand it. </span></p>

Not only are these going to be the units by which you measure the success of the campaign, but the ratios will be used to adapt your campaign to trends and changes in the future. For example, if you are receiving five likes for every one conversion (actual sales made after likes and clicks), then you are in pretty good shape, but one thousand likes for every one conversion means there is probably something amiss, and you will need to find a way to close the deal on interested users. </span></p>

The short term results of using spam bots or other unsavory methods are simply not worth what you will invest. Instagram is constantly on the lookout for spamming accounts, and they get banned regularly. Even if they don’t find you out right away, the users will hardly be fooled. If you post an advertisement something most people have never heard of, and get 200,000 likes in the first hour, most users are savvy enough to see right through that. Even using organic marketing services, which offer actual people to like and comment on your posts for a price, is simply not as effective as working with the system for actual organic likes over the long haul. </span></p>

A fantastic product will get you a loyal base, and little expansion. However, a quality product combined with quality content on Instagram will bring in the kind of users that are actually looking to buy, and if you impress them, they will help to spread the word for you through likes and word-of-mouth.</span></p>

Steve Anderson, who was the founder of Baseline Ventures, invested $250,000 in Systrom’s idea for an app called Burbn that allowed users to share their location with friends, but he requested that Systrom find a partner to work with in developing the app. Systrom found Krieger, and between the two of them they simplified the original idea, making it a simple photo-sharing app. Unlike most apps and businesses which are built from the ground up, Instagram is unique in that it was actually built from a pre-existing app taken down to its most basic components.It was introduced to Apple in 2010, and before the app would even be introduced to Android in 2012, it already had more than thirty million users.

This was just an indicator of the enormous success that Instagram would see throughout the next few years. This is probably why Facebook made the wise decision to purchase Facebook for $1 billion in cash and stocks. The purchase of Instagram by Facebook was actually quite astonishing, considering the fact that Instagram was not generating any revenue at all at the time.<br /><br /></p>

In 2013, Instagram introduced direct messaging to the platform, which gave users more direct contact with one another. In 2015, advertising was added to the platform, which is how they began to generate some serious revenue. They also introduced live streaming, which again increased the direct contact between users. One of the most recent updates to the platform was the change that made likes hidden from users. The idea behind this was to place less focus on the likes, and more on engagement between users. This change has not been around long enough to really know the impact yet, but the response seems to be fairly positive for the time being. Even though likes are now hidden from other users, they are still just as valuable to anyone attempting a promotional campaign for a business or organization, </span><em>because likes are still the best way to measure your reach on Instagram.</em></p>

A like is what the viewer does to indicate to you that they have viewed something that you posted, and that they enjoyed it or agreed with it. By double-tapping the video or picture, the viewer “likes” it, and each like is added to a tally that is visible only to the person or organization that posted it. Likes are not meant to share the picture or video with other viewers, and they do not indicate that the person intends to do any business with your company. Likes are nothing more than an acknowledgement that your post was viewed and appreciated. That being said, likes are vitally important, but not as easy to come by as you might think. In this article, we will continue to explore the surprisingly complex system of gaining likes on Instagram. </span></p>

The new algorithm was introduced to replace the old chronological order because Instagram was becoming so popular, with over 400 million users at the time, that showing the posts chronologically was no longer a sensible way for the platform to operate. Another reason for the change was the introduction of advertisements, which would be fitted into the new algorithm. </span></p>

The new algorithm would upend the whole marketing operation on Instagram, because now technology would decide who wees what based on the users own follows, and who they actually engage with. This was great for the individual user, but proved to be a difficult change for social media marketers. The marketers adapted to the new system, of course, but the algorithm is fairly organic and changes regularly, so marketers are forced to stay on their toes and adapt to regular changes. Overall the new algorithm seems to have had a positive impact on the platform, and the response from users seems fairly receptive. </span></p>

Instagram uses Facebook Business to operate its advertising, and Facebook has access to more information about individuals than perhaps any other platform in the world. This means that every advertiser can find out if you are interested in sports cars, classical music, weight loss, chocolate, family photography, or all of the above. If you have ever expressed an interest in anything that can be sold, Facebook Business knows about it, and they can use that information to target very specific demographics. This caused a great deal of controversy during the 2016 presidential elections. While the concern about this is quite understandable, at the end </span>of the day it hardly matters as far as advertising is concerned, because advertising is not just about informing one specific base demographic, it is also about expanding the base. Advertising will always be focused on converting those that were not previously interested, which means the primary goal of all advertisement is to reach as many people as possible. Yes, they can and do use user’s information to target specific groups, but chances are most of those users would see those advertisements anyway.</p>

Keep in mind that more money does not automatically equal a more impactful campaign. If you are looking to sell an app that connects members of one specific neighborhood in one specific city, you don’t really need a budget big enough for a nationwide campaign. In fact, you might even be able to get away with something like an influencer putting the word out, in which case you may not even need an advertising campaign. </span></p>

Earlier we said that the main goal of advertising is to reach as many people as possible, including those that are not already in your base, but that does not mean it isn’t essential that you know who your base is. For instance, if you were writing a young adult fantasy novel about a group of female heroes fighting against a tyrannical male, your first instinct might be to think that your core demographic is young females between the ages of 14-21. While that is probably true, there would also be some room for young males in college, feminist activist groups, and just fantasy-genre lovers in general. You can test different core groups in order to find the most profitable demographic. The key here is for you to focus on your demographic when creating and advertising so that you can keep your base, while also attempting to expand it. </span></p>

Not only are these going to be the units by which you measure the success of the campaign, but the ratios will be used to adapt your campaign to trends and changes in the future. For example, if you are receiving five likes for every one conversion (actual sales made after likes and clicks), then you are in pretty good shape, but one thousand likes for every one conversion means there is probably something amiss, and you will need to find a way to close the deal on interested users. </span></p>

The short term results of using spam bots or other unsavory methods are simply not worth what you will invest. Instagram is constantly on the lookout for spamming accounts, and they get banned regularly. Even if they don’t find you out right away, the users will hardly be fooled. If you post an advertisement something most people have never heard of, and get 200,000 likes in the first hour, most users are savvy enough to see right through that. Even using organic marketing services, which offer actual people to like and comment on your posts for a price, is simply not as effective as working with the system for actual organic likes over the long haul. </span></p>

A fantastic product will get you a loyal base, and little expansion. However, a quality product combined with quality content on Instagram will bring in the kind of users that are actually looking to buy, and if you impress them, they will help to spread the word for you through likes and word-of-mouth.</span></p>
